<h1 class="h4">Encryption Keys and Post-it Notes: A Comedy of Errors</h1>
<p>
  In the realm of code, a developer once dwelled,<br>
  His website, a creation he proudly held.<br>
  With lines of logic and algorithms vast,<br>
  He ventured forth, confident his site would last.<br>
</p>

<p>
  But alas! The fates had a wicked plan in store,<br>
  As his dreams of security began to crumble more.<br>
  With each attempt to fortify his digital domain,<br>
  A comedic tragedy began to take its reign.<br>
</p>

<p>
  First came the passwords, oh, how they faltered,<br>
  Simple combinations that even a child altered.<br>
  "123456" and "password" they merrily chose,<br>
  Leaving the developer in a state of woeful woes.<br>
</p>

<p>
  He scratched his head, pondering encryption keys,<br>
  But alas, he stumbled upon a blunder with ease.<br>
  For in his haste, he left the keys on a post-it note,<br>
  And his sensitive data fell prey to a hacking gloat.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Next, he installed firewalls to keep danger at bay,<br>
  Yet their settings were awry, much to his dismay.<br>
  With a flick of a switch, he blocked himself out,<br>
  Leaving his site vulnerable, with nary a doubt.<br>
</p>

<p>
  He delved into the world of secure sockets layer,<br>
  Aiming to protect his users from lurking snares.<br>
  But alas, he misconfigured the SSL certificate,<br>
  And his visitors were greeted by an error that wouldn't quit.<br>
</p>

<p>
  His attempts at securing the site grew more absurd,<br>
  With each failed endeavor, his confidence was blurred.<br>
  He patched the holes, only to create more cracks,<br>
  A tragic comedy playing out, attracting the hackers' attacks.<br>
</p>

<p>
  His users' passwords were leaked, their data exposed,<br>
  And the developer was left shaking, feeling morose.<br>
  He had failed in his quest to safeguard the virtual space,<br>
  And his reputation, once esteemed, was now a disgrace.<br>
</p>

<p>
  But amidst the chaos, a lesson he did learn,<br>
  That security is not a task one can easily spurn.<br>
  With humility, he sought to rectify his mistakes,<br>
  To rebuild his site, and protect it for the users' sakes.<br>
</p>

<p>
  So let this tale be a cautionary guide,<br>
  To all developers who in code take pride.<br>
  Secure thy sites with diligence and care,<br>
  Lest you become the protagonist of a tragic affair.<br>
</p>
